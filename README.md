# dataset-division-to-train-val-test-python
python script for diving image data to train test and val

If you have a image dataset in the following structure of directories
- root directory
-- label_1 directory
-- label_2 directory
-- label_3 directory
-- label_n-1 directory
-- label_n directory

then this python script (main.py) will divide the images present in each label directories into train, val and test directories.
